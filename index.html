          <p>Hello pookie, I want to say sorry for the last few days/weeks. Things have been rough for me but that is no excuse because I know yours are 10x more tough than mine.
            I haven't been able to muster the courage to admit my mistakes and to chat you again, but now I have. I'm sorry for not chatting you for the past 5 days and for being cold to you in the days before.
            I feel bad and I admit ignoring and not chatting with you is very wrong. I'm sorry if I make you sad or stressed despite already having a hard time in Bali. I was being overly possessive over you and starts
              limiting your freedom that I have no right to control.
            I promise to not do the same mistake again, I also will never ignore you again and won't reply coldly to you again. I want to be more direct in communicating with you. <br>I'm so sorry and I love you so much. <br>I miss you :(
            <br><br> -Yours
          </p>
